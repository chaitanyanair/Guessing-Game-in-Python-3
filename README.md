# Guessing-Game-in-Python-3
This is the first game that I have built in Python. The rules of the game are as follows:
1. You will guess a number between 1 to 100
2. If you guess the number generated by the computer correctly, you WIN!
3. If your guess is within 10 digits of the correct number, we will tell you you are WARM
4. If your furher guesses are closer that 10 digits, we will tell you you are WARMER
5. If your consequtive guesses are farther than 10 digits, we will say you are COLDER
6. If your guess is NOT within 10 digits of the correct number, we will tell you you are COLD
7. You will enter guesses until you have guessed the number correctly
