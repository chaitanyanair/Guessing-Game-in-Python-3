# Guessing-Game-in-Python-3
This is my first game that I built in Python. The rules of the game are as follows:
You will guess a number between 1 to 100
If you guess the number generated by the computer correctly, you WIN!
If your guess is within 10 digits of the correct number, we will tell you you are WARM
If your furher guesses are closer that 10 digits, we will tell you you are WARMER
If your consequtive guesses are farther than 10 digits, we will say you are COLDER
If your guess is NOT within 10 digits of the correct number, we will tell you you are COLD
You will enter guesses until you have guessed the number correctly
